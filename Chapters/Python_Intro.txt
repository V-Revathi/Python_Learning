The Python Tutorial:

easy to learn - syntax as like normal english
powerful - versatile, cross-platform
high-level data structures - list,tuple and dictionary
object-oriented programming - classes, objects, encapsulation ,...
dynamic typing - memory allocated for variables at run time
interpreted - code executed line by line 
scripting language - short & simple set of instructions, used for automating task or extnd functionality

freely available as source - code is available in human readable format
& binary form - as machine readable(ex: .exe)
python.org contains - third party python modules - developed & maintained by individual/org outside core python. 
	Ex: NumPy - install using pip

Python interpreter - easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++.
self-contained document

description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library - library contains built-in modules
 	(written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O .
The Python Language Reference - more formal definition of the language. 
To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter - can extend 
	with new modules with functions & more. (with 3rd party library: Cython: like CPython or without 3rd party library) 

and Python/C API Reference Manual.
