task you’d like to automate- perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files,
 rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way.
small custom database
a specialized GUI application, or a simple game

A specialized GUI application, or Graphical User Interface application, is a program designed with a user-friendly, visual interface that uses elements like windows, icons, and menus, tailored for a specific task or industry, rather than a general-purpose application. 
work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow - writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task
A "test suite" is a collection of related test cases designed to verify a specific functionality or set of behaviors in a software application or system, enabling efficient management, execution, and reporting of test results. 


A shell script is a text file that contains commands for a Unix operating system. It's a way to automate tasks by combining a sequence of commands into a single file. 
A Windows batch file is a script file (with a .bat or .cmd extension) that contains a series of commands to be executed sequentially in the Windows command prompt or PowerShell, allowing for automation of tasks. 
Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.

python- high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.
Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl.
AWK (/ɔːk/) is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.
Perl is a general purpose, high level interpreted and dynamic programming language. Perl supports both the procedural and Object-Oriented programming. Perl is a lot similar to C syntactically and is easy for the users who have knowledge of C, C++.(Text Processing).

split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs.
modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.-Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit, providing a way to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python, and is included with standard Python installations.

 Python - save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.

Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
    the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
    statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
    no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
Python is an extensible language, meaning you can extend its capabilities by integrating code written in other languages like C or C++, enhancing performance and allowing access to existing libraries. 


simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.
